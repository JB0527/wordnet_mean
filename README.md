Install NLTK and Download WordNet: Ensure NLTK is installed and download the WordNet data.

Find Synsets for a Given Noun: For any given noun, find its synsets in WordNet.

Extract Relations:

Hypernyms: Find the more general terms for a given synset.
Hyponyms: Find the more specific terms.
Coordinate Terms: Find terms that are siblings within the hierarchy (share the same hypernym).
Holonyms: Find terms that the given noun is a part of.
Meronyms: Find terms that are parts of the given noun.
Synonyms: Find synonymous terms within the same synset.
Antonyms: Find opposite terms, particularly for adjectives and adverbs.
Metonyms: WordNet does not directly support finding metonyms, as they involve a kind of figurative or representational relationship not explicitly modeled in WordNet. We can note this limitation in our discussion.
Function Implementation: Implement a function that takes a noun as input and returns its related terms as per the above relations.

Handle Multiple Meanings: Since a word can belong to multiple synsets (have multiple meanings), the code should account for this and potentially aggregate or differentiate the relations based on the synset.

Let's start coding this in the Python Code Interpreter. We'll focus on implementing a function that receives a noun and returns its hypernyms, hyponyms, coordinate terms, holonyms, meronyms, synonyms, and antonyms. We'll note the limitation regarding metonyms in our implementation. Since NLTK and WordNet cannot be directly used in this environment, I'll write the code as if they were available.

I've written a function that takes a noun as input and finds its WordNet relations, including hypernyms, hyponyms, coordinate terms, holonyms, meronyms, synonyms, and antonyms. This function iterates through all the noun synsets of the given word, aggregating related terms for each category. It returns a dictionary where each key corresponds to a type of relation and its value is a sorted list of related terms.

Here's a summary of how each relation is handled:

Hypernyms: More general terms.
Hyponyms: More specific terms.
Coordinate Terms: Siblings within the hierarchy (share the same hypernym).
Holonyms: Terms that the given noun is a part of.
Meronyms: Terms that are parts of the given noun.
Synonyms: Synonymous terms within the same synset.
Antonyms: Opposite terms, especially for adjectives and adverbs.
It's important to note that WordNet does not directly support finding metonyms, which involve figurative or representational relationships not explicitly modeled in WordNet. Thus, this function does not attempt to retrieve metonyms.

Before proceeding to testing or optimization, do you have any specific requirements or modifications in mind for this code? ​​
